# GraphQL [Directly query the Whisk server]

All data in Whisk is served via a GraphQL API. Whisk SDK's components and hooks abstract this away (but use it under the hood). 
If you need direct data access or want to use Whisk outside of React, you can use the GraphQL API directly. 

API: `https://api.whisk.so/graphql`

## Playground

The [Whisk GraphQL playground](https://api.whisk.so/graphql) is a great way to explore the API and test queries. To use the playground:

::::steps
### Generate API key if you haven't already

The API key will be sent to your email address. This is the same key you use for the SDK.

<GenerateKey />

### Add authorization header

In the `Headers` section of the playground, add the following:

```json [Headers]
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
}
```

### Query the API

Try running a query like this:

```graphql [Example Query]
{
  identity(address: "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045") {
    aggregate {
      name
      avatar
      bio
    }
  }
}
```
